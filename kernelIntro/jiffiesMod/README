	This program is a simple kernel module that that prints out the
current value of jiffies whenever /proc/jiffies is read. Much of the 
programs structure and function make up comes from the hello.c example
provided in the virtual machine. The program is fairly basic as far as 
kernel modules go, and required fairly little non-standard code.

	The ssize_t proc_read function runs whenever /proc/jiffies is read.
It first reads in the current value of jiffies. Then creates all of the 
variables needed in the function. It then creates the string that will be 
output and copies is to the user space buffer.

	The proc_init function and proc_exit function are fairly simple and 
similar in function. The first simply creates the /proc/jiffies entry and
the other removes it.
